        <h2>How did you get the data?</h2>
        <p>
          Slugtistic's data was obtained through the California Public Records
          Act (CPRA) to access grade distribution information from UCSC. The
          data obtained from the CPRA was then processed and stored in a
          database to be used by this application.
        </p>
        <h2>How far does the data go back?</h2>
        <p>Slugtistic's data goes back to Fall 2014.</p>
